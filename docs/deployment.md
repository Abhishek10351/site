# Deployment
The default Dockerfile should do a good job at running a solid web server that
automatically adjusts its worker count based on traffic. This is managed by
uWSGI. You need to configure the `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` variables. If
you want to deploy to a different host than the default, configure the
`ALLOWED_HOSTS` variable.

## Static file hosting
You can either collect the static files in the container and use uWSGI to host
them, or put them on your host and manage them through a web server running on
the host like nginx.

## Database migrations
To bring the schema up-to-date, first stop an existing database container, then
start a container that just runs the migrations and exits, and then starts the
main container off the new container again.

## Ansible task
An example Ansible task to deploy the site is shown below, it should read fairly
humanly and give you a rough idea of steps needed to deploy the site.
