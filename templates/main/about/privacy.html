                    We take every step to ensure that your data is used ethically and that includes making sure that
                    you know exactly what data we collect, and what we do with it. That means that instead of a
                    bunch of legalese, we've provided this information in an easy, human-readable form below.

                    data, or shipping it off to third parties. Our community is entirely volunteer-run - it does
                    not have any form of monetary income whatsoever - and we believe that this is how it should be.

                            We no longer automatically remove any data if you leave the community, and we no

                            We're no longer tracking anything related to Code Jams. Our data collection is now
                            strictly limited to data available through your Discord user. Because we believe it now
                            falls to Discord to ensure they have your consent for collecting this data, we no longer
                            collect explicit consent.

                            As we're replacing Rowboat (the bot we use for moderation), we need to hold onto some of
                            your data - even after you've left the server. This is necessary to ensure the smooth
                            running and security of our community.

                            While we don't collect your email addresses, they are visible on GitLab if you email an
                            issue directly to our <code>meta@</code> email address, but only to staff.

                            We no longer collect GitHub usernames - instead, we collect GitLab usernames. Additionally,
                            we now collect user avatar URLs for display purposes.

                            Rectified an omission in the old privacy policy, where the system information you provide
                            as part of a code jam signup wasn't mentioned.

                            We no longer collect your date of birth, and all collected dates of birth have been
                            removed from our database. The reason for this is that Discord itself already complies with
                            GDPR - and in order for you to sign up for a code jam, you must already have a Discord
                            account.

                            Completed the first version of our privacy policy. We also updated our OAuth scopes for
                            Discord logins - we no longer collect your email, or get the access to join you to servers
                            automatically. All collected emails have also been removed from the database.
