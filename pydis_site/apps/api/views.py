class RulesView(APIView):

    Return a list of the server's rules.

    ## Routes
    ### GET /rules
    Returns a JSON array containing the server's rules:

    ...     "Eat candy.",
    ...     "Wake up at 4 AM.",

    Since some of the the rules require links, this view
    gives you the option to return rules in either Markdown
    or HTML format by specifying the `link_format` query parameter
    as either `md` or `html`. Specifying a different value than
    `md` or `html` will return 400.

        Build the markup necessary to render `link` with `description`

            link (str):
                The resulting link that a user should be redirected to
