## Contributors Community
We are very happy to have many members in our community that contribute to [our open source projects](https://github.com/python-discord/).
Whether it's writing code, reviewing pull requests, or contributing graphics for our events, it’s great to see so many people being motivated to help out.
As a token of our appreciation, those who have made significant contributions to our projects will receive a special **@Contributors** role on our server that makes them stand out from other members.
That way, they can also serve as guides to others who are looking to start contributing to our open source projects or open source in general.

#### Guidelines for the @Contributors Role

One question we get a lot is what the requirements for the **@Contributors** role are.
As it’s difficult to precisely quantify contributions, we’ve come up with the following guidelines for the role:

- The member has made several significant contributions to our projects.
- The member has a positive influence in our contributors subcommunity.

The role will be assigned at the discretion of the Admin Team in consultation with the Core Developers Team.


# How do I start contributing?
  Completing these steps will have you ready to make your first contribution. If you've already been using Git or GitHub feel free to skip those steps, but please make sure to read about the PyDis contributing process and ettiquette. If you are here looking for the answer to a specific question, check out the sub-articles in the top right of the page to see a list of our guides.



### Fork the repo
   GitHub is a website based on the Git version control system that stores project files in the cloud. The people working on the project can use GitHub as a central place for sending their changes, getting their teammates' changes, and communicating with each other. Forking the repository that you want to work on will create a copy under your own GitHub account. You'll make your changes to this copy, then later we can bring them back to the PyDis repository.

   [Check out our guide on forking a GitHub repo](./forking-repository/)

### Clone the repo
  Now that you have your own fork you could make changes to it directly on GitHub, but that's not a convenient way to write code. Instead you can use Git to clone the repo to your local machine, commit changes to it there, then push those changes to GitHub.

  [Check out our guide on forking a GitHub repo](./forking-repository/)

### Set up the project
  You have the source code on your local computer, but how do you actually run it?

### Ettiquette
  [Guidelines](./contributing-guidelines/)
### Read the style guide
  [Style Guide](./style-guide/)

### Open a pull request

### The review process
  [Review Guide](../code-reviews-primer/)
### Create an issue


### Learn the basics of Git
  Git is a *Version Control System*, software for carefully tracking changes to the files in a project. Git allows the same project to be worked on by people in different places. You can make changes to your local code and then distribute those changes to the other people working on the project.

If you don't understand anything or need clarification, feel free to ask any staff member with the  **@PyDis Core Developers** role in the server. We're always happy to help!
