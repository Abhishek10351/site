This document is intended to help you maximize your chances of finding an answer to your question.

# Things to avoid

### Asking "Can I ask a question?"
You can always ask, so go ahead!

### Asking "Does anyone here know about ..."
Instead, ask your actual question. While this might be intended to attract people who know about certain topics, it's just an extra step. People can tell from the question what it is about, and people who aren't experts on the topic might still be able to help.

### Posting code (or other text) as a screenshot
Those who help you will likely need to copy and paste parts of your code, error message, or other text you provide. If you provide text in screenshot form, this won't be possible. Screenshots may also be difficult to read on some devices.

Use this formatting to paste code in Discord:

> \```py\
 <code goes here, after the line break>\
\```

Or use our [pastebin](https://paste.pydis.com/) for longer text samples.

### Asking "Why doesn't this work?"
That can mean a lot of things. Explain what you expected the code to do, and what it actually did. That can include getting the wrong output or getting an error message.

If you get an error message, always share the whole error message (aka *traceback*), as this often contains valuable information.


# What to do instead

Now that we've covered what not to do, here is information that your question *should* contain:

* An explanation of:
    * What the code is meant to do, and the larger problem you're trying to solve. Describe your goal, not just your approach.
    * What is going wrong. Are you getting an error? An output you didn't expect?
* A code example that illustrates your problem.
* The full traceback if your code raises an exception. Don't leave anything out of the traceback, as you might exclude information crucial to solving your issue.
