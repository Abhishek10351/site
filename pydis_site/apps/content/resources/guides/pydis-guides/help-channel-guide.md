On the 5th of April 2020, we introduced a new help channel system at Python Discord. This article is a supplementary guide to explain precisely where to go to find help.

We have two different kinds of help channels in our community - **Topical help channels**, and **general help channels**.
Where you should go depends on what you need help with.
These channels also attract different helpers, and move at different speeds, which affects the kind of help you're likely to receive, and how fast you get that help.

# Topical Help Channels

The topical help channels move at a slower pace than the general help channels.
They also sometimes attract domain experts - for example, `#async-and-concurrency` has CPython contributors who helped write asyncio, and in `#game-development` you can find the creators and maintainers of several game frameworks.
If your question fits into the domain of one of our topical help channels, and if you're not in a big hurry, then this is probably the best place to ask for help.

Some of the topical help channels have a broad scope, so they can cover many related topics.
For example, `#data-science-and-ai` covers scientific Python, statistics, and machine learning, while `#algos-and-data-structs` covers everything from data structures and algorithms to maths.

Each channel on the server has a channel description which briefly describes the topics covered by that channel. If you're not sure where to post, feel free to ask us which channel is appropriate in `#community-meta`.

# General Help Channels

Our general help channels cycle quickly, with the advantage of attracting a more diverse spectrum of helpers, and getting individual attention and help for your question. These channels are a great choice for generic Python questions, but they can be used for domain-specific Python help as well. 
Be sure to [ask good questions](../asking-good-questions) in order to give yourself the best chances of getting help. 

## How To Claim a Channel

There are always 3 available help channels waiting to be claimed in the **Python Help: Available** category.

This message is posted when a channel becomes available for use:

In order to claim one, simply start typing your question into one of these channels. Once your question is posted, you have claimed this channel it will be moved down to the **Occupied Help Channels** category.

At this point you will have the **Help Cooldown** role which will remain on your profile until your help channel is closed (with the `!closed` command) or goes dormant due to inactivity.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: How long does my help channel stay active?

The channel remains open for **30 minutes** after your last message, but if another user posts in your channel, the closing will be delayed by 10 minutes.

*You'll see this message in your channel once it goes dormant:*

## Q: No one answered my question. How come?

The server has users active all over the world and all hours of the day, but some days are less active than others. If no one answered your question, feel free to claim another help channel a little later.

If you still feel like your question is being overlooked, read our guide on [asking good questions](../asking-good-questions) to incease your chances of getting a response.

## Q: I don't need my help channel anymore, my question was answered. What do I do?

Go ahead and move your channel to the dormant category by running the `!closed` command. You will only be able to run this command in your own help channel, and likewise no one will be able to prematurely close your claimed help channel (with the exception of staff).

## Q: Are only Helpers supposed to answer questions?

Absolutely not. We strongly encourage all members of the community to help answer questions. If you'd like to help answer some questions, simply head over to one of the help channels that are currently in use. These can be found in the **Python Help: Occupied** category.

Anyone can type in these channels, and users who are particularly helpful [may be offered a chance to join the staff on Python Discord](/pages/server-info/roles/#note-regarding-staff-roles).

## Q: I lost my help channel!

No need to panic.
Your channel was probably just marked as dormant.
All the dormant help channels are still available at the bottom of the channel list, in the **Python Help: Dormant** category, and also through search.
If you're not sure what the name of your help channel was, you can easily find it by using the Discord Search feature.
Try searching for `from:<your nickname>` to find the last messages sent by yourself, and from there you will be able to jump directly into the channel by pressing the Jump button on your message.
