If you need to run your bot 24/7 (with no downtime), you should consider using a virtual private server (VPS).

There are no reliable free options for VPS hosting. If you would rather not pay for a hosting service, you can consider self-hosting. Any modern hardware should be sufficient for running a bot. An old computer with a few GB of ram could be suitable, or a Raspberry Pi (any model, except perhaps one of the particularly less powerful ones).
