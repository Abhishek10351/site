            <p>At Python Discord, we run a few regular events such as programming contests and workshops, as well as more ad-hoc events such as Python release streams. All members are welcome to participate in the events live, and for most events we release videos on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PythonDiscord">YouTube channel</a> after the event in case you've missed it.</p>
            </p>To subscribe to the announcements, head over to the bottom of the <code>#roles</code> channel and get the <code>@Announcements</code> role to receive notifications on the latest updates!</p>
