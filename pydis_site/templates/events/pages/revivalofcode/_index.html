<p>
    Each year, many of our members take part of an online coding competition called
    <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a> that takes place in December. Advent of Code is an
    Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved
    in any programming language you like, including Python.
</p>
<p>
    Revival of Code is a Python Discord hosted event where we release old Advent of Code puzzles from a previous year. The puzzles start off easy and gradually get more difficult, all while revealing a fun little story that is appropriate for some seasons more than others. Questions will be posted every other day, and you'll be able to discuss your solutions in dedicated threads.
</p>

<h3 class="is-title is-3">Keeping up with the puzzles</h3>
<p>
    To be notified when new problems are posted you can subscribe to the <code>@Revival of Code role</code> in <code>#roles</code>.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions or want to discuss the event in general, come talk about it in‚Å†<code>#Revival of Code Discussion</code>.
